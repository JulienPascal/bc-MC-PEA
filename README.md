# bc-MC-PEA

This repository contains the code for the paper bc-MC-PEA paper.


## Folders and Files
### Folder `1.stochastic_growth`
Solve the stochastic growth model using standard PEA, as well as bc-MC-PEA. The notebook `stochastic_growth_Colab_1.ipynb` was executed on Google Colab (CPU, High RAM mode). This created the zip file stochastic_growth_Colab_1.zip.

### Computational details

All computations were performed in Google Colab (CPU, High RAM mode) using Python 3.11.12 on an 8-core AMD EPYC 7B12 processor running at 2.25 GHz. See the results of "cpuinfo" at the end of the notebook for more details.
